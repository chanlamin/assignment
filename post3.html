      <h2>Budgeting for Rent: Know How Much Rent You Can Afford</h2>

        <h3>How much should you spend on rent?</h3>
          <p>Before starting your apartment or rental home search, you should anticipate spending about 30 percent of your income on rent. Depending on several factors, you may spend more or less on your rent budget. These factors can include your location and cost of living, any debt payments, and your future financial goals.

              Budgeting for your location
              Choosing where you live can greatly impact your potential rental budget. Compared to mid-size cities or suburban areas, most large cities have higher rent prices and a higher cost of living. If you plan to live in a more expensive area, you’ll likely spend a greater share of your income on rent than you would elsewhere. Depending on your budget and goals, that may be the right choice.

              You can’t always choose where you live based on average rents or the cost of living. For example, you may have chosen your city for career reasons or the proximity to nature. Note that there are many ways to balance higher costs of living against other factors, such as a location’s:

              Career opportunities
              School district
              Proximity to friends or relatives
              Healthcare facilities
              Climate
              Commute time
              Public transportation options
              Food and nightlife options
              Proximity to airports and travel hubs
              Each person or household is going to have a different list of priorities. However, it’s always a good idea to keep an open mind about where you choose to live. While there are many ways to budget for rent that make even the most expensive cities affordable, you may not want to sacrifice all other factors to make it happen. </p>
              <h3>Calculate how much rent you can afford</h3>
              <p>To calculate how much money you should spend on rent, you’ll need to start with your monthly income after taxes, or “net income.” Your net income is what you’ll be using to pay your bills. Once you know what you can expect to take home each month, then consider your financial obligations and financial goals.

                Financial obligations are the things you must pay. That includes insurance, credit card debt payments, groceries, and other expenses. Financial goals are financial milestones you’re working toward, such as retirement and mortgage down payment. Once you have a basic idea of these two financial factors plus your expected or net pay, you can work backward to determine a realistic budget. </p>
