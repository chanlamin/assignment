        <p>Moving to a new location can be an exciting time. You’re thrilled to explore a new city but also anxious to find an apartment to call home as soon as possible. However, there’s more than just rent and location to consider when apartment hunting. Whether you’re planning on moving across the country or to a new building in your current city, we put together information to help you prepare for the costs associated with moving into a new apartment, such as the security deposit, renter’s insurance, broker’s fee, and furniture essentials, to name a few.

          Read on for answers to common questions like:

          How much is rent?
          How much do apartments cost based on location?
          What other costs come with renting an apartment?
          How can I reduce my expenses?
          To understand how much an apartment costs, you’ll need to learn what factors contribute to rental costs. Most cities have apartments for rent at a range of different prices. To focus your search on units you can reasonably afford, keep in mind the rule thumb that says your income should be at least 3x your rent. That means to afford an apartment that rents for $2,000 per month, your monthly income needs to be at least $6,000 per month.</p>
          <h3>How much does an apartment cost in your state?</h3>
          <p>The national average rental rate for apartments is helpful as a rough estimate for what you should expect to pay for your next apartment, but costs will vary by state and size of the city. For example, an apartment in a large city will typically cost more than an apartment in a suburban or rural area.

            Below is a table that lays out average costs for one and two-bedroom apartments in every state for 2021  and how that has changed from the previous year. Except in Nebraska, where rents have slightly decreased on average, all other states have experienced varying increases in rental prices.</p>
