      <h2>What is Security Deposit?</h2>

        <h3>Why do landlords ask for a security deposit?</h3>
        <p>A security deposit is meant to protect your landlord. When you sign your lease, you typically agree to two important things:

          Paying your rent on time for the extent of your lease
          Protecting the rental unit from damages beyond normal wear and tear
          But not all tenants deliver on these promises. To help ensure tenants take care of their responsibilities, landlords or property management companies ask for security deposits. If you decide to break your lease, a landlord might have the right to keep your deposit as a means to cover the lost rent and the costs to find a new tenant.

          Most of the time, the security deposit covers physical damages to the home. For example, a hole in the wall, broken cabinetry, or damaged flooring. The repair cost is deducted from the security deposit at the end of the lease. In many states, the landlord is required to present the tenant with an itemized list of damages and repair costs.</p>

          <h3>How does a security deposit work?</h3>
          <p>A security deposit is an agreed-upon amount paid at the beginning of a lease. Tenants pay the security deposit before moving in, often paid with the first and last month’s rent at the lease signing. Sometimes landlords will ask for the security deposit before the lease signing date to secure the apartment. Whenever you pay your deposit, ask for a receipt. Your landlord is obligated to give you one along with your leasing paperwork.

          The landlord or property management company holds the tenant/’s security deposit during your lease term. Many states require the landlord to put the money in a particular savings or bank account held separately from other funds, called an escrow account.

          When your lease ends, the tenant moves out of the apartment and the landlord completes an inspection. So long as the tenant follows all moving out rules and the apartment is in good condition, the landlord returns the security deposit funds. If the state laws dictate, the landlord may also be required to pay interest on those funds.

          Security deposits during lease renewals
          If you decide to renew your lease, you may be asked to pay an additional security deposit. This is common when your rent payment increases. Not all landlords will ask for more deposit money, but don’t be surprised if they do.</p>

          <h3>What does a security deposit cover?</h3>
          <p>A security deposit typically covers financial obligations the tenant owes the landlord or property manager at the end of the rental agreement, such as unpaid rent, fees, and utilities. Security deposits may also cover unpaid physical damages. Here’s a closer look at what a security deposit can cover:</p>

          <h3>Property damage</h3>
          <p>A landlord can’t recover costs for reasonable wear and tear, but they can make deductions for damages beyond what’s normal. Your lease should have a clause about what is considered as “damage.” Some state laws allow landlords to withhold funds to cover damage for something as small as a nail hole.

            It’s also important to note that tenants can be held financially responsible for not alerting their landlord to certain issues like mold growth. Always review your lease carefully before signing and again before moving out.

            Unpaid utilities
            Many states allow landlords to withhold security deposits for unpaid utility bills. Some states only allow security deposits to cover some types of utilities. Always be sure to check your state and local laws.

            Outstanding fees
            Depending on the terms of your lease, your landlord or property manager may charge fees for things like pest control in addition to your monthly rent. Another standard fee is for late charges. For example, if any fee is left unpaid when you move out, your landlord may be allowed to deduct it from your security deposit.

            Leaving a dirty apartment
            Most leases will have some clause about the condition the tenant is supposed to leave the apartment in when they move out. For example, tenants may need to have the apartment professionally cleaned. If the apartment is not thoroughly cleaned, the landlord or property management company can charge a cleaning fee.

            Pet deposit
            If you moved in with a cat or dog, you likely paid a pet deposit or pet rent. If not, your landlord may deduct damages caused by your pet or special cleaning fees from your security deposit.</p>
